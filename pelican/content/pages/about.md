I am a postdoc in physics at [Aarhus University][AU] working in
[the ion trap group][group] of Prof. [Michael Drewsen][Drewsen]. My
current research activities involve state preparation and precision
spectroscopy of cold molecular ions as part of the [COMIQ][]
network. Previously, I was a graduate student in
[Mike Chapman's lab][ChapmanLab] at [Georgia Tech][GT] working with
trapped Th<sup>3+</sup> and Ba<sup>+</sup> ions. More details on my
research can be found [here](research.html).

In my spare time, I enjoy [photography](photography.html), various
outdoor activities, reading, and working on various projects related
to [Arduino][], [Raspberry Pi][RPi], and open source software. Lately
I have been particularly interested in interacting with physical
devices via web-based interfaces. Most of my projects can be found on
[GitHub][] (see also [my Gists][]).

For fun, and as a service to the ion trapping community, I maintain
the
[Ion Trapping Periodic Table](http://mike.depalatis.net/ionptable/). This
aims to be a handy reference for ion trappers with information on
transition wavelengths, photoionization schemes, and more.
