I am a scientific software developer in the
[Computational Memory Lab][CML] at the University of Pennsylvania
where I am a part of the DARPA [RAM][] team. Previously, I was an
experimental atomic physicist. I was a postdoc in
[the ion trap group][group] of Prof. [Michael Drewsen][Drewsen] at
[Aarhus University][AU] and earned my PhD in
[Mike Chapman's lab][ChapmanLab] at [Georgia Tech][GT].

In my spare time, I enjoy [photography](photography.html), various
outdoor activities, reading, and working on various projects related
to [Arduino][], [Raspberry Pi][RPi], and open source software. Lately
I have been particularly interested in interacting with physical
devices via web-based interfaces. Most of my projects can be found on
[GitHub][] (see also [my Gists][]).

For fun, and as a service to the ion trapping community, I maintain
the
[Ion Trapping Periodic Table](https://mivade.github.io/ionptable/). This
aims to be a handy reference for ion trappers with information on
transition wavelengths, photoionization schemes, and more.
