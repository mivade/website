I am a scientific software developer, data engineer, and physicist. I
currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Ascend Analytics][] in
Boulder, Colorado. In a past life I was an experimental atomic
physicist in [the ion trap group][group] after earning my PhD at
[Georgia Tech][GT].

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, various outdoor activities, reading, and
working on various projects related to [Arduino][], [Raspberry Pi][RPi], and
open source software. Lately I have been particularly interested in interacting
with physical devices via web-based interfaces. Most of my projects can be found
on [GitHub][] (see also [my Gists][]).

For fun, and as a service to the ion trapping community, I maintain
the
[Ion Trapping Periodic Table](https://mivade.github.io/ionptable/). This
aims to be a handy reference for ion trappers with information on
transition wavelengths, photoionization schemes, and more.
