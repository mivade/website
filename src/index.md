# About

I am a computational scientist at [Inscripta][], a gene editing technology
company located in Boulder, Colorado. Previously I was a part of the DARPA
[RAM][] team in the [Computational Memory Lab][CML] at the University of
Pennsylvania. Before entering the world of professional scientific software
development, I was an experimental atomic physicist. I was a postdoc in [the ion
trap group][group] of Prof. [Michael Drewsen][Drewsen] at [Aarhus University][AU]
and earned my PhD in [Mike Chapman's lab][ChapmanLab] at [Georgia Tech][GT].

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, various outdoor activities, reading, and
working on various projects related to [Arduino][], [Raspberry Pi][RPi], and
open source software. Lately I have been particularly interested in interacting
with physical devices via web-based interfaces. Most of my projects can be found
on [GitHub][] (see also [my Gists][]).

For fun, and as a service to the ion trapping community, I maintain
the
[Ion Trapping Periodic Table](https://mivade.github.io/ionptable/). This
aims to be a handy reference for ion trappers with information on
transition wavelengths, photoionization schemes, and more.
